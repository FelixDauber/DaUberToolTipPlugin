# DaUberToolTipPlugin
Made By:
Felix Dauber


Quickly set it up in 3 simple steps.

1. Add the tooltip manager prefab to any canvas (Make sure to put it far down in the heirarchy so it isn't behind anything)

2. Add a toolTip script to any gameObject and give it a description

3. Have some coffee.


Extras:
You can manually set what you want to use as a tooltip. The plugin comes with a couple, But you can also create your own one.
Set it by pulling the prefab into the toolTipManager's toolTip reference.
You can even use things which are already in the scene, Just reference that specific item. It will automatically detect that it isn't a prefab.

You can change the update frequenzy of the toolTipManager so that it doesn't use too much performance or you want it to be more responsive.
As a standard it is set quite high in order to show off it's responsiveness.
